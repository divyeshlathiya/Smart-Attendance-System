# 🧠 Face Recognition Attendance System

A smart, secure, and deep learning-powered **Attendance System** built with **Django**. It uses **MTCNN** for real-time face detection, **VGGFace2** for face recognition, and an **anti-spoofing model** to distinguish real faces from fake ones (e.g. photos or videos).

## 📸 Features

- 🔍 Face Detection using **MTCNN**
- 🧬 Face Recognition via **VGGFace2 Embeddings**
- 🛡️ **Anti-Spoofing** to block fake or replay attempts
- 🗂️ Admin Panel to manage students and attendance
- 🧑‍🎓 Student onboarding with face image registration
- 📊 Attendance reporting (by student, date, or session)
- 🎥 Live webcam integration for real-time processing

## 🔐 Anti-Spoofing Module

The system includes a CNN-based anti-spoofing layer that checks if the detected face is real or a spoof (photo/video). If spoofed, attendance is not marked and an alert is logged.

## 🧠 Face Recognition Pipeline

1. **Detection** - Real-time face detection using MTCNN.
2. **Embedding** - Embeddings generated via VGGFace2.
3. **Comparison** - Match embeddings with the registered database using cosine similarity.
4. **Spoof Check** - Confirm liveness via anti-spoofing model.
